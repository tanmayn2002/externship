Analytics For Hospitals' Health-Care Data

Introduction:

The recent Covid-19 pandemic has drawn attention to an often overlooked aspect of healthcare management: the use of data science. One crucial factor to consider and predict in order to improve the efficiency of hospital management is the length of stay (LOS) for patients.

By analyzing the LOS, hospitals can identify patients who are at a high risk of staying for an extended period when they are admitted. Once these high LOS-risk patients are identified, their treatment plans can be optimized to minimize their length of stay, reducing the likelihood of staff and visitor infections. Additionally, having prior knowledge of the expected length of stay can assist in logistical planning, such as room and bed allocation.

Assuming the role of a Data Scientist at Health Man, a nonprofit organization dedicated to managing hospitals professionally and efficiently, the goal is to accurately predict the length of stay for each patient on a case-by-case basis. This information will enable hospitals to allocate resources optimally and improve their overall functioning. The length of stay is categorized into 11 different classes, ranging from 0-10 days to more than 100 days.
