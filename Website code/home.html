            1. Introduction <br>
The purpose of this project was to perform a comprehensive healthcare analysis of a hospital <br>
using data visualization tools like Tableau and Cognos. The analysis aimed to provide insights <br>
 into various aspects of the hospital's performance and patient care, including patient demographics, <br>
 key performance indicators (KPIs), resource utilization, and operational efficiency. The findings were <br>
  then presented on a website using the Bootstrap framework to ensure a visually appealing and responsive user experience <br>
2. Methodology <br>
The project followed the following methodology: <br>
a) Data Collection and Preparation: For this project, the data was obtained from our instructor, <br>
who provided a comprehensive dataset containing relevant healthcare information. The dataset encompassed <br>
various aspects of the hospital's operations, including patient demographics, medical procedures, billing <br>
records, and operational data.:
b) Analysis and Visualization: The cleaned and preprocessed data was then imported into Tableau and Cognos, <br>
two powerful data visualization tools. Different visualizations and dashboards were created to explore and <br>
analyze various aspects of the hospital's performance and healthcare trends. These tools provided an intuitive <br>
and interactive platform for data exploration, enabling the project team to derive meaningful insights.
c) Website Integration Using Bootstrap: To make the analysis easily accessible and visually appealing, a website <br>
was developed to showcase the findings. The Bootstrap framework was employed for website development due to its <br>
 responsive design, extensive pre-built components, and mobile compatibility. The visualizations and dashboards <br>
 created in Tableau and Cognos were embedded into the website to allow users to interact with the data and explore the insights.
